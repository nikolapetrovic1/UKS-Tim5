## Model
Current version of class diagram can be viewed at: [https://app.diagrams.net/](https://app.diagrams.net/)

## Setup:

### Create venv (outside of project):

```python
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Start virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Clone repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/JSTheGreat/UKS-Tim5
cd UKS-Tim5
```

### Run with docker:

You will need docker installed on your machine and set to run on Linux containers.

```python
# This image should be pulled before (re)creating the containers (below)
docker pull jsthegreat/uks-tim5
```

```python
# To setup the environment and run the Django app, execute the following command:
docker-compose up

# It is possible to order the docker-compose to build uks_tim5_web the container:
docker-compose up --build

# If all containers should be recreated, then execute:
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate
```

App will be running on [http://localhost:8083/](http://localhost:8083/), but you may need to wait a couple of seconds for it to start


## Monitoring Containers Separately

The following command can be used to investigate the PostgreSQL db.

```python
# enter the container
docker exec -it uks_tim5_db bash
# authenticate as pg user (enter password)
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -W
# listing tables 
\d 
# see the content of an arbitraty table
SELECT * FROM "public"."GitApp_repository";
```

### Access to Redis mem-cache

To investigate the content of Redis mem-cache, execute the following commands:

```python
# enter redi container
docker exec -it uks_tim5_redis bash
# use redis-cli to inspect

# list all keys
